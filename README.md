## ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)

ATS stands for Applicant Tracking Systems, which are software applications used by employers to manage and automate the hiring process. When submitting a resume, it's important to consider the following points regarding ATS:

- **Automatic Rejection:** ATS systems can automatically reject resumes that do not meet specific criteria or match the desired qualifications. Resumes are typically filtered and ranked based on keywords, qualifications, and other requirements set by the employer.

- **Machine Readability:** To optimize your resume for ATS, ensure that it is machine-readable. Use a PDF format when submitting your resume to maintain formatting and ensure that the content is accessible to the ATS.

- **Recommended Websites:** If you need assistance in creating a well-formatted resume, there are several websites you can consider. Here are two popular options:

  1. [novoresume.com](https://novoresume.com): Novoresume provides a user-friendly platform with pre-designed templates that are ATS-friendly. It offers customization options and allows you to export your resume in PDF format.

  2. [overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com): Overleaf is a collaborative LaTeX editor that allows you to create professional-looking resumes with LaTeX templates. LaTeX resumes are often favored by ATSs for their clean structure. You can export your resume from Overleaf as a PDF.

- **Machine Readability Check:** To ensure that your resume is machine-readable, you can use tools like [resumeworded.com](https://resumeworded.com). It helps analyze and assess the readability of your resume by ATS. However, note that while resumeworded.com can provide insights, it may not be the best tool to assess overall resume quality or suggest improvements.

Remember, optimizing your resume for ATS is crucial to increase the chances of getting past the initial screening process. By ensuring machine readability, proper formatting, and keyword optimization, you can enhance your resume's chances of being selected by the ATS for further consideration by hiring managers.

## Underline and Bold Words
Use capital letters for titles and names, such as "Software Engineer" or "John Smith." Avoid using all caps for important words within sentences. Instead, consider using underline or bold for emphasis. Be cautious not to overuse underline or bold formatting, as it can diminish their effectiveness. Maintain consistency in formatting choices for a professional appearance. Use underline sparingly to enhance your resume's presentation and draw attention to key details. Remember, the goal is to make your resume visually appealing and easy to read. Use underline and bold judiciously to strike the right balance and avoid making them ineffective.

## Where to Use Capital Letters
When writing your resume, it's important to use capital letters appropriately. Follow these guidelines:

1. Titles and Names: Capitalize the first letter of titles, such as "Software Engineer" or "Project Manager," and proper names, such as "John Smith" or "Google Inc."
2. Important Words: Avoid using all capital letters for important words or phrases within sentences. Instead, consider using other formatting options like underline or bold to highlight essential information.


## Having Multiple Resumes

Developers can benefit from having multiple resumes when applying for different positions that require specific skill sets. If you are a full stack developer, it's recommended to have three separate resumes tailored to three different roles: front-end, back-end, and full stack.

Each resume should be customized to emphasize the relevant skills, technologies, and experience for the specific role you are targeting. This includes adjusting the summary section and skills section to highlight the most relevant qualifications and achievements.

By creating distinct resumes for each position, you can ensure that you present yourself as the ideal candidate for the specific job requirements. This approach allows you to showcase your expertise in a focused manner and increase your chances of getting noticed by recruiters.

Remember to carefully review and modify your summary and skills section for each resume, removing any non-relevant skills or experiences.

## Tailoring Your Resume

Tailoring your resume for each job position is a highly effective strategy that increases your chances of getting noticed by recruiters and securing job interviews. Here are three key areas to focus on when tailoring your resume:

1. **Summary:** Craft a summary section that aligns with the job description. Use placeholders to highlight the most relevant points from the job requirements. By customizing your summary, you can immediately capture the attention of recruiters and show them that you possess the key qualifications they are seeking.

Example: ```Results-driven software engineer with over 10 years of experience in full-stack development, specializing in [front-end technologies]. Proficient in [HTML], [CSS], and [JavaScript frameworks] such as [React.js] and [Angular]. Strong problem-solving abilities and a track record of delivering high-quality code [on time and within budget]. Passionate about creating [intuitive user interfaces] and optimizing [user experiences].```

2. **Skills:** Review the job description and identify the skills and qualifications that are specifically mentioned or highly valued by the employer. Adjust your skills section accordingly, adding, removing, or reordering skills to highlight those that are most relevant to the position. This demonstrates your suitability for the role and increases the likelihood of getting shortlisted.

3. **Job Experience:** When describing your job experience, carefully analyze the job description to identify the most critical responsibilities and requirements. Tailor the bullet points in your job experience section by emphasizing the accomplishments and experiences that closely align with the job description. Consider rearranging the order of bullet points to showcase the most relevant experiences first, ensuring that your resume immediately demonstrates your fit for the role.

By tailoring your resume to each job position, you demonstrate a strong understanding of the employer's needs and present yourself as an ideal candidate. This personalized approach significantly increases your chances of getting selected for interviews and ultimately securing the desired job opportunities.

## Resume Length

The ideal length of a resume depends on your experience level and the specific requirements of the job. However, as a general guideline:

- For entry-level positions or recent graduates, a one-page resume is usually sufficient to highlight relevant skills and education.

- For mid-level professionals with several years of experience, a two-page resume is commonly used to provide a comprehensive overview of skills, experience, and achievements.

- For senior-level or executive positions, a longer resume may be acceptable, but it should still be concise and focused on the most relevant information.

Remember, it's important to prioritize quality over quantity and ensure that every section of your resume adds value to your application.

## LinkedIn

Your LinkedIn profile should mirror your resume, serving as an online representation of your professional identity. Ensure that the information on your LinkedIn profile aligns with your resume, including your work experience, skills, and accomplishments. Keep your profile updated, engage with professional connections, and utilize LinkedIn's features to enhance your visibility and explore career opportunities.

# Structure
Each resume has multiple parts:
- [Head (including Summary/Objective)](#Title)
- [Skills](#skills)
- [Job Experience](#job-experience)
- [Interests](#interests)
- [Education (optional)](#education)
- [Projects (optional)](#projects)
- [Awards/Achievements (optional)](#awardsachievements)


# Title
## Name

Let's say your first name is "Mamad Reza" and your last name is "Gholipor Gol Mamadi". While it's not necessary to use your full name, it's often recommended to use a combination of one word from each name, such as "Mamad Gholipor". Another option is to use a given name for the first name, for example, "Mickle".

Remember, the goal is to present your name in a way that is easily recognizable and professional, ensuring it aligns with your personal preferences and the professional image you want to convey.

## Title
You should clearly present your professional title, such as "Front-End Developer", to accurately represent your expertise. It's important to be specific about your role to avoid confusion. For example, if you are applying for front-end development positions, it's better not to present yourself as a "Software Engineer".

Remember, you want to make it easy for recruiters or anyone reviewing your resume to quickly identify your profession without having to search for it within your skills section.

## Contact
Include the following contact details in your resume:

- **Email:** Provide your professional email address, ideally using your full name (e.g., john.doe@example.com). Using a professional email address helps create a positive impression on potential employers.

- **LinkedIn:** Create a custom LinkedIn profile URL that includes your name (e.g., linkedin.com/in/johndoe). Customizing your LinkedIn URL adds a professional touch to your online presence. Refer to [this document](linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a542685/manage-your-public-profile-url?lang=en) for instructions on how to customize your LinkedIn URL.

## Summary

The summary section is a crucial part of your resume as it provides a concise overview of your professional profile. Pay attention to the following key points when crafting your summary:

- **Indicate Total Years of Experience:** Start your summary by mentioning your total years of experience in the relevant field. If you have over 5 years of experience, use the format "Results-driven software engineer with over [X] years of experience." For less than 5 years of experience, use the format "Results-driven software engineer with [+X] years of experience." This helps recruiters quickly gauge your level of expertise.

- **Use Third-Person Grammar:** Write your summary in the third person to maintain a professional tone throughout your resume.

- **Highlight Priorities:** Clearly state your priorities, emphasizing the key skills, expertise, and qualities that set you apart in your industry.

- **Focus on Achievements:** Highlight your significant accomplishments and contributions, showcasing tangible results whenever possible.

- **Concise and Engaging:** Keep your summary concise and engaging, using powerful language and dynamic descriptions to capture the attention of hiring managers.

Remember, the summary is your chance to make a strong first impression. Craft it carefully to highlight your unique value proposition and entice employers to delve further into your resume.

##### Examples
- Results-driven software engineer with over 6 years of experience in full-stack development. Proven track record of designing and implementing scalable solutions for complex business challenges. Skilled in JavaScript, Python, and modern frameworks. Collaborative team player with strong problem-solving abilities and a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly software applications.

- **Highlight Key Skills:** Focus on the skills that are most important and sought after in your field. Research the job requirements and industry trends to identify the skills that will make your resume stand out.

- **Prioritize Relevant Skills:** Order your skills strategically, placing the most relevant and in-demand skills at the top. Consider the job requirements and industry trends to identify the skills that hiring managers are seeking for the position. Highlight skills such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, etc., prominently to capture immediate attention.

Note: The skills section should be placed right after the head (summary/objective) section. This allows hiring managers to quickly assess your relevant skills and qualifications early in the resume, making a strong first impression.

Note: It's generally better not to include soft skills in the skills section. Soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and time management, are better showcased in the summary and work experience sections.

For example, "MM/YYYY - MM/YYYY." It's important to ensure that the dates of your job experiences do not conflict with each other. In case of conflicts or gaps in your resume, you can use the year format instead of the exact month and year.

4. **Company Description:** Provide a brief description of the company or organization you worked for, focusing on its industry, size, and any notable accomplishments or specialties. This helps provide context for your role within the organization.

5. **Bullet Points Resume:** List your key responsibilities, achievements, and contributions in bullet point format. Start each bullet point with an action verb and highlight measurable results or notable outcomes whenever possible. Quantify your achievements and use specific examples to showcase your impact and skills.

Remember, the job experience section is an essential part of your resume, allowing you to demonstrate your expertise, accomplishments, and contributions in previous roles.

### Bullet Points

When listing your responsibilities, achievements, and contributions in bullet point format, follow these guidelines:

- Use the ```ed (past)``` format for the verbs to describe what you have done in each bullet point. For example, use "Developed," "Implemented," "Managed," etc., to indicate past actions.

- Each bullet point should consist of two parts: 
  - The first part describes what you have done, highlighting specific tasks or responsibilities.
  - The second part indicates the impact or results of your actions, showcasing measurable outcomes or achievements.
  - Example: Developed a responsive web application using React.js and Redux, improving user experience and reducing load time by 30%.

Prioritize your bullet points effectively. Place the most important and impactful bullet points at the beginning to capture the reader's attention. Start with the most relevant and significant achievements that align with the job requirements and highlight your expertise. By following a logical order and sorting your bullet points effectively, you can make a strong impression on hiring managers and showcase your capabilities.

Remember, bullet points provide an opportunity to showcase your accomplishments and the value you have brought to your previous roles. Focus on highlighting the specific actions you took and the measurable impact you made. Quantify your achievements whenever possible to provide tangible evidence of your contributions.

Additionally, ensure that your bullet points are clear and do not leave the hiring manager with unanswered questions. Avoid bullet points that prompt question marks or require further clarification, as they may create confusion or uncertainty. Be concise, yet descriptive, in your bullet points to provide a clear understanding of your responsibilities and achievements.
